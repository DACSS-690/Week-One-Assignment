- Title: Democratic Backsliding Data

Introduction
- This repo has three datasets--Freedom House, V-Dem and LIED which measures a country's level of democracy. Freedom House is a non-governmental organization with some federal funding from the United States government. Researchers at Gothenburg University in Sweden produce the V-Dem dataset. Professor Skaaning, Svend-Erik at Aarhus University, in Denmark, is the lead researcher in creating the LIED dataset.
