This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
#file.choose() found the directory path for each file
LIED <- read_excel("/Users/dftorres/Documents/GitHub/DPP690/Week-One-Assignment/Data/LIED_6.6.xlsx")
V_Dem <- read.csv("/Users/dftorres/Documents/GitHub/DPP690/Week-One-Assignment/Data/V_Dem_CORE.csv")
Freedom_House <- read_excel("/Users/dftorres/Documents/GitHub/DPP690/Week-One-Assignment/Data/Freedom_House_Data_from_2003_to_2020.xlsx", 2)
Freedom_House_2 <- read_excel("/Users/dftorres/Documents/GitHub/DPP690/Week-One-Assignment/Data/Freedom_House_Data_from_2003_to_2020.xlsx", 3)
head(LIED)
head(V_Dem)
head(Freedom_House)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
